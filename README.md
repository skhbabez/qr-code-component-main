## My process

- Set up HTML structure according to the figma file
- Creating a stylesheet
- Applying global styling like centering and setting up variables
- Styling each component set up in the HTML in accordance with the FIGMA files

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Refreshed lots of basics regarding working with text in css.

### Continued development

Read up on on inheritance in CSS. Do I need or should I use this much Flex? Would simple text-align and margins been enough?

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Great Reference.
